.SYNOPSIS
    Configures the registry to disable third-party suggestions in Windows Spotlight, in compliance with STIG ID WN10-CC-000390.

    Windows Spotlight may suggest apps and content from third-party publishers, which could expose users to unvetted or unnecessary software. 
    This script ensures that these suggestions are disabled by setting the appropriate registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
