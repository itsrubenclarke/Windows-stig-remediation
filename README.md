### üìñ Overview

This repository demonstrates a structured approach to identifying and addressing technical noncompliance when compared with the: 

- [DISA Windows 10 STIG baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Technical_Implementation_Guide).
  
It combines enterprise compliance scanning with automated remediation using PowerShell.

After conducting a credentialed compliance scan in Tenable, several configuration issues were identified that introduced risks to system integrity, auditability, and baseline hardening. These findings highlighted control failures across areas such as audit logging, access control, and privilege management.

To correct these issues, I developed a set of targeted PowerShell scripts, each aligned to a specific STIG control. The remediations were individually applied and verified through follow-up scans to ensure that each finding was resolved and the system returned to a compliant state. This process created an auditable trail of corrective action and supports ongoing assurance and compliance validation.

This project demonstrates hands-on technical capability in:

- üîç Identifying and analysing technical nonconformities using enterprise tools
- üõ† Designing and applying corrective actions mapped to specific control objectives  
- ‚úÖ Validating remediation outcomes through measurable evidence  
- üìÅ Maintaining documentation that supports audit readiness and continual improvement

This portfolio serves as both a technical showcase and a practical demonstration of how an information security management system can be supported by automated control remediation and verification.
