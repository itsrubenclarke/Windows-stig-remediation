### üìñ Overview

This repository documents my practical approach to identifying and remediating Windows 10 STIG compliance issues using Tenable and PowerShell.

After running a credentialed compliance scan in Tenable, multiple misconfigurations were detected against the:
- [DISA Windows 10 STIG baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Technical_Implementation_Guide).
  
Each failure represents a gap in system hardening, including areas like audit logging, privilege management, and access control.

To address these, I developed a series of targeted PowerShell scripts, each focused on remediating a specific STIG control. These scripts were tested individually, and their success was verified through subsequent Tenable scans.

This project demonstrates hands-on technical capability in:

- üîç Identifying misconfigurations using enterprise tools (Tenable.io)  
- üõ† Writing and applying PowerShell remediations for specific findings  
- ‚úÖ Confirming fixes through iterative scanning and validation  
- üìÅ Documenting each implementation for repeatability and audit readiness  

This portfolio serves as both a technical showcase and a personal record of progress in implementing security controls aligned with DISA STIG requirements.
